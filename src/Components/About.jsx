      <Text p>
        I remember when I visited my college town a couple years back, I had to
        physically sit down on the lawn at one point, just because of the sheer
        weight of memories rushing back to me. How Joey and I used to cut
        through the bushes on the way to class. The doorway I was walking
        through when I got Zoe&apos;s text that I had won a free water bottle.
        The feeling of biking uphill on the way to the soccer fields, every
        Tuesday and Thursday night, Fall quarter.

        And I was just thinking that those memories will always remain there,
        waiting to be pulled up if I came by again, no matter where I go or that
        I forget that I have them. And I was wondering how many were out there.

      <Text p>The other idea is less heady, in a way.</Text>
      <Text p>
        I was trapped, silent for a day, drowning in the memories of the people
        I&apos;d met, the interactions I&apos;d had, in my past lives. When I
        was living and working in the Lower Haight, and I&apos;d pop by our
        bodega and chat with the dude there, speaking bad Spanish but laughing
        about our novel conjugations. The park where no one said how they felt.
        The last time I talked to my cousin in person, and didn&apos;t thank him
        enough. The man I met in Tapachula, who was making his way north to
        Veracruz. He had been deported a few months before, and had not wanted
        to wait in Honduras while his family worked to bring him back. He&apos;d
        resolved to work with his hands, repairing cars with his friend, rather
        than wait for something that seemed like an impossibility. We had spent
        our time waiting for the bus, trading songs on guitar, paused together,
        before the next leg of our trips.

      <Text p>And I was just wondering how everyone was.</Text>

        Feel free to leave something of your own, and maybe we can hold these
        moments together.
